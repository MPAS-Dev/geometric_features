# Arctic Ocean Regions

TO BE EDITED
Features used to extract temperature and salinity time series, following
Figs. 4 and 5 in Timmermann and Hellmer (2013).  Most features are derived from
their Fig. 3. Additional regions have been added for the Western and Eastern
Weddell Seas and for East Antarctic Seas (covering the remainder of the
continent).  These 3 regions are loosely based on analysis regions from
Kusahara and Hasumi (2013).
