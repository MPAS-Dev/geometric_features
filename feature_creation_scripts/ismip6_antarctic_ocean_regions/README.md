# ISMIP6 Antarctic Ocean Regions

Features used to compute regional and temporal mean temperature and salinity
for comparison with the model selection process in
[Barthel et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-855-2020), which was
 used to select CMIP5 models for
 [ISMIP6](http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/mips/ismip6).
