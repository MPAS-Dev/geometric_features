Aggregate Existing Features
===========================

The :py:mod:`geometric_features.aggregation` module contains functions used to
aggregate existing features to make new, larger ones.

The only aggregation function that is currently available is
:py:func:`geometric_features.aggregation.ocean.subbasins`, which aggregates
oceanic regions to make the following ocean subbasins: North and South Atlantic,
North and South Pacific, Indian Basin, Arctic Basin, and Southern Ocean Basin.
