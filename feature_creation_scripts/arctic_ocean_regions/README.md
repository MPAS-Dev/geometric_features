# Arctic Ocean Regions

Arctic Ocean regions based on three criteria:
1) oceanography-relevant regions, with tag=Arctic. Some of these
regions have also been tagged with 'Arctic_Basin' so that a 'Arctic_Ocean'
feature can be created by combining the 'Arctic_Basin' features (note that
it is always a good idea to double check mask files created with combined
features);
2) seaice-relevant regions, with tag=Arctic_NSIDC (defined according to
NSIDC standards; see https://nsidc.org/data/masie/browse_regions
for a map, and https://nsidc.org/data/g02186?qt-data_set_tabs=2
for more details)
3) Beaufort Gyre definition as in Proshutinsky et al. (2009),
with tag=Arctic_Proshutinsky.
