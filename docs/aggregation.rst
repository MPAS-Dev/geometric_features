Aggregate existing Features
===========================

This can be used to aggregate existing features to make new, larger ones.

The only aggregation function that is currently available is `ocean.subbasins_regions`,
which aggregates oceanic regions to make the following ocean subbasins: North
and South Atlantic, North and South Pacific, Indian Basin, Arctic Basin, and 
Southern Ocean Basin.
